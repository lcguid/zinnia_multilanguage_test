# zinnia_multilanguage_test

Add support for multi-language blog posts to Zinnia and Django

This project provides a working Django 1.7.5 / Zinnia 0.15.1 project with support for multi-language posts. This work was based on the post from Daniel Gonzalez that you can find here http://codeispoetry.me/index.php/django-blog-zinnia-multilanguage-support-with-django-modeltranslation/

The original post used older version and did not work properly. The only thing that is still not working is the wymeditor in the admin interface. Please let me know if you have a fix for that.

Cheers.
